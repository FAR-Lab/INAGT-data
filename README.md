# Is Now a Good Time? Dataset

## Overview
The Is Now a Good Time (INAGT) dataset consists of automotive, physiological, and visual data collected from drivers who self-annotated responses to the question "Is now a good time?," indicating the opportunity to receive non-driving information during a 50-minute drive. We augment this original driver-annotated data with third-party annotations of perceived safety, in order to explore potential driver overconfidence. The dataset includes data from 46 drivers and 1915 samples.

## Data
- 1915 samples across 46 drivers during a 28.5 km route
- Yes / No annotations from drivers if it is a good or bad time to interact
- 3rd part rating of Safe / Unsafe moments (from MTurk raters)
- Road video, driver face video, driver side video, and driver over shoulder video
- Automotive data (CAN) from a 2015 Toyota Prius
- Physiological data from driver
- Pre-computed road object detection (via I3D Inception V1)
- Pre-computed Font body pose (via OpenPose)
- Pre-computed facial landmarks (via OpenPose)
- Pre-computed side body pose (via OpenPose)
