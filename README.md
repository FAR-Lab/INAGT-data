# Is Now a Good Time? Dataset

## Overview
The Is Now a Good Time (INAGT) dataset consists of automotive, physiological, and visual data collected from drivers who self-annotated responses to the question "Is now a good time?" indicating the opportunity to receive non-driving information during a 50-minute drive. We augment this original driver-annotated data with third-party annotations of perceived safety to explore potential driver overconfidence. The dataset includes data from up to 61 drivers.

## Data
- 1915 samples across 46 drivers during a 28.5 km route
- Yes / No annotations from drivers if it is a good or bad time to interact
- 3rd part rating of Safe / Unsafe moments (from MTurk raters)
- Road video, driver face video, driver side video, and driver over shoulder video
- Automotive data (CAN) from a 2015 Toyota Prius
- Physiological data from the driver
- Pre-computed road object detection (via I3D Inception V1)
- Pre-computed Font body pose (via OpenPose)
- Pre-computed facial landmarks (via OpenPose)
- Pre-computed side body pose (via OpenPose)

## Public Dataset
We provide an [anonymized, publicly available dataset](https://purl.stanford.edu/gj863qr6417) where 61 participant videos have been blurred and pre-computed video data (i.e., road objects, body pose, facial landmarks) is provided for 6 seconds before and 6 seconds after each "Is Now A Good Time?" query. The dataset is provided as-is and without warranty of any kind. If you use the data in your work, please take a look at the Recommended Citation Guidelines below to cite and acknowledge.

## Requesting the Full Dataset
The full, non-anonymized dataset is available for research use. Interested parties must have IRB approval and/or agree to our Data Use Agreement to use the data.
